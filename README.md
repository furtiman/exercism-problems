# Exercism practice repository of Ivan Turasov

## Description

This repository contains my solutions to problems from [exercism.io](https://exercism.io) mentored code practicing platform. I have taken this challenge to improve my skills in the languages I am
already familiar with, as well as learn and practive new ones.

Every language has their own track with tasks of various complexity. In my pracitce I am doing all the tasks sequentially, from the easiest ones to the hardest, even if for
some basic problems I might feel that it is so easy I could possibly skip this (hello-world etc.)

## Languages that I have entered the track for so far

* [Go](https://github.com/furtiman/exercism-problems/tree/master/go)
* [C++](https://github.com/furtiman/exercism-problems/tree/master/cpp)
